= CSV SubSampler
A simple program to sub-sample csv data from the command line.

== Usage
```
SubSampler --interval i [--sample column] [--indentity col1,col2,..] [--input in] [--output out]
```


This will read file `in` (default stdin) and write to file `out` (default stdout), processing each line.
For each line, will look at column `column` (0-based), parse this as a number and will not emit the line unless interval `i` has elapsed.

Additionally, one can provide indices of columns that need to be treated as identifiers for each line. Last-seen values will then be kept per group.

== Examples

Given input
```
1,hello
2,world
3,how
5,are
6,you
7,?
```

then passing through `SumSampler --interval 2` will output
```
1,hello
3,how
5,are
7,?
```

With the following input:
```
1,1377986401,68.451,0,11,0,0
2,1377986401,19.927,1,11,0,0
3,1377986401,11.721,0,2,0,0
4,1377986401,9.472,1,2,0,0
5,1377986401,0,1,11,0,0
6,1377986402,0.355,0,3,0,0
7,1377986402,68.451,0,7,0,0
8,1377986406,17.743,0,7,0,0
9,1377986406,0,1,11,0,0
10,1377986406,3.701,0,9,0,0
```

then an invocation of `SubSampler --interval 5 --sample 1 --identity 3,4,5,6` will output

```
1,1377986401,68.451,0,11,0,0
2,1377986401,19.927,1,11,0,0
3,1377986401,11.721,0,2,0,0
4,1377986401,9.472,1,2,0,0
6,1377986402,0.355,0,3,0,0
7,1377986402,68.451,0,7,0,0
9,1377986406,0,1,11,0,0
10,1377986406,3.701,0,9,0,0
```

* Line 5 is for the same identity of `1,11,0,0` as line 2 and delta is 0 (< 5)
* Line 8 is for the same identity of `0,7,0,0` as line 7 and delta is 4 (< 5)
